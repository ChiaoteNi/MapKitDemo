# MapKitDemo

This repo is a demo code for MapKit, showcasing the following features:
- Lookaround
- LocalSearch
- MKDirections

The repo was created in 4 steps:
- Initial state - listing the requirements prompts
- Adding comments about the tools in other files to inform the AI tool of the available tools
- 1st version - implementation with some assistance from AI tools
- 2nd version - business logic split and handled by the interactor and other objects

During the development of the demo code, I did not commit all steps. 
However, you can review the code step by step with these 4 commits to see the important changes.
